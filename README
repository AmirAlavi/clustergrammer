This is a D3 clustergram with zoom/panning, reordering, and search. The user can add classes to the rows and columns that will color the triangles on the row/column labels. The clustergram is also capable of displaying a dendrogram-like row/column grouping. The colored bars under row/column labels identify groups of rows/columns that are similar to each other based on a distance cutoff which can be controlled using the sliders. D3 Clustergram was developed by Nick Fernandez at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
