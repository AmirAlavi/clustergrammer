Introduction
============
Clustergrammer is an interactive web-based tool for visualizing high-dimensional data as hierarchically clustered heatmap. Clustergrammer can be used in three main ways: 1) web application, Jupyter notebook interactive widget, and JavaScript and Python libraries. This section will provide quick instructions on how to

Interactivity
=============
Clustergrammer is built to enable users to intuitively explore/analyze high-dimensional datasets and has many interactive features:

- zooming/panning
- row/column reordering (e.g. reorder based on sum)
- interactive dendrogram
- dimensionality reduction (e.g. filter rows based on variance)
- interactive row/column categories
